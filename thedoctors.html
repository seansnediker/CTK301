  *Insistently* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do! You've swallowed a planet! No... It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness.</p>

  <p>You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? <span class="spanugly">I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why.</span> I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why. You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff. They're not aliens, they're Earth...liens!</p>

  <h3>Inferno</h3>
  <p class="dave2">I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship. The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things...hey...the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant. It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'! Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME!</p>

  <p class="dave3">It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'! I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship. No... It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness. You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better? I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship.</p>

  <h5>The Doctor's Daughter</h5>
  <p>You've swallowed a planet! Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! <span class="spanblue">I'm the Doctor</span>, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you? You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas?</p>
